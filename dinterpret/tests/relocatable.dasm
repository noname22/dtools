; Test of a relocatable program

; Program

:start
	set x, rel:message	; set x to the relative distance beetween
				; x and pc after this instruction

	add x, pc		; add pc's value after this instruction
	sub x, 1		; fix the offset, subtract the length of the previous instruction

				; x now contains the address of message, regardless of where in memory this
				; program has been loaded to
	
	set i, 9		; for i = 9 to 0
	
	:loop
		sub i, 1

		set push, x	; push x and call "puts"
		sys 2

		ifg i, 0	; relative jump to loop, add because it wraps in ram
			add pc, rel:loop

	set a, 0		; exit the program with status 0
	sys 0	

; Data

:message .DW "Hi!", 0xa, 0
